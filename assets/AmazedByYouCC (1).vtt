This looks really cool.

00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:34.095
This is amazing, right?

25
00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:40.602
Why don't you guys go and play,

26
00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:41.978

lunch is ready, okay?

27

guys go too far.

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:46.817

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.652

35
00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:57.410

36

camping up here?

38
00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:01.788
- Does it ever get old?
- Never.

39
00:02:01.873 --> 00:02:03.833
- Have you ever
seen, like, a bear?

40
00:02:03.917 --> 00:02:05.793
- No, no.

41
00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:07.587

wanted to see a bear?

43
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.803

be best friends forever?

44
00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:16.678
- Of course we will.

45
00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:19.182

46
00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:20.683

47
00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:21.977
- We need a name, though.

48
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.312
- Yeah, like the Cool Kids Club.

49
00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:25.730

50
00:02:25.813 --> 00:02:27.315

- That's real bad.

51
00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:28.525
- How about the Bulldogs?

52
00:02:28.608 --> 00:02:30.652
- Ew, no, they slobber too much.

53
00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:32.695

139
00:07:09.597 --> 00:07:12.308
In the miracle of the loaves
and fishes, Jesus working

140
00:07:12.392 --> 00:07:16.020
with one small boy of
faith took an average meal,

141
00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:17.688
and He fed thousands of people.

142
00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:20.190
And it wasn't about the food.

143
00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:25.070
It was about one young man
willing to step up and believe.

144
00:07:26.822 --> 00:07:29.117
Well, in conclusion,
let me quote

145
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.785
from the words of the
mighty man, Samson,

146
00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.455
who in the Book of
Judges said, and I quote,

147
00:07:34.538 --> 00:07:36.498
"Who's got their
spaghetti dinner tickets?"

148
00:07:36.582 --> 00:07:38.960

- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

154
00:07:47.468 --> 00:07:49.220
- Could you tell me
what happened with
the funeral service?

155
00:07:49.303 --> 00:07:51.347
Today, it was supposed
to be for Tim John.

156
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.640
- This is a different event.

157
00:07:52.723 --> 00:07:54.850
The funeral was a
couple of days ago.

158
00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:55.685
- Thank you.

00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:00.438

161
00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.780
So what exactly
did they tell you

162
00:08:08.865 --> 00:08:10.575
when you took that
message for me?

163
00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:11.367
- Um,

164
00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:17.373
Timothy John, Tucson,

165
00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.583
Rocking K Ranch,

166
00:08:20.793 --> 00:08:22.920
something about a horse

167
00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:23.795
and a funeral.

168
00:08:24.588 --> 00:08:26.507
- Okay, think carefully.

169
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.675
Do you think there's
any way possible

170
00:08:27.758 --> 00:08:29.843
they told you two days ago?

171
00:08:29.927 --> 00:08:31.012
- Oh, you know, there
was a lot going on

172
00:08:31.095 --> 00:08:32.222

Are you guys friends of Tim's?

183
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.267
- Yes, and Tim also
worked on our ranch.

184
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.435
He was a heck of a roper.
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:09:19.518 --> 00:09:20.978
- Wait, a roper?

186
00:09:21.062 --> 00:09:23.022
- Yeah, he was quite the cowboy.

187
00:09:23.105 --> 00:09:24.648
- Tim was a cowboy?

188
00:09:24.732 --> 00:09:26.442
- When was the last time
you saw your friend, son?

189
00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:28.152
- Oh we were best
friends growing up,

190
00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:29.862
just went separate
ways after high school.

191
00:09:29.945 --> 00:09:32.238
My co-worker took the
phone call about his death,

192
00:09:32.323 --> 00:09:35.408
but unfortunately, there
was a mix-up of dates.

193
00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:36.785
I took the first
train here out of LA

194
00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:38.203
as soon as I heard.

195
00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:39.330
Probably head back
tomorrow, though.

196
00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:41.790
- Where are you staying tonight?

197
00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:43.042
- Haven't really planned.

198
00:09:44.002 --> 00:09:45.795
- Let's head out to the
ranch for some dinner,

199
00:09:45.878 --> 00:09:48.172
and we can take you to
the cemetery tomorrow.

200
00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:49.465
- Looks like it's been a while

201
00:09:49.548 --> 00:09:51.300
since you've had a
home-cooked meal.

202
00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:52.258
- Me?
- Yeah (laughs).

203
00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.433
(dramatic music)

204
00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:21.330
- [Tom] What do
you think so far?

205
00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:22.665
- It's quite a
place you have here.

206
00:10:22.748 --> 00:10:24.500
- 5,500 acres.

207
00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:26.127
- It must take a lot of
people to keep it up, right?

208
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.920
- Well, we can always
use an extra hand

209
00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:30.297
if you want to stick
around for a while.

210
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.925
- Yeah, why don't you just
sleep over after dinner tonight.

211
00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:34.760
You can stay in
Timothy's bunkhouse.

212
00:10:36.012 --> 00:10:37.095
- Yeah, we'll see.

213
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.932
This smells
delicious by the way.

214
00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:40.975
- Why, thank you.

215
00:10:42.352 --> 00:10:43.727
- Thanks, babe.
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:10:44.687 --> 00:10:47.898
(gentle music)

217
00:10:47.982 --> 00:10:49.525
- So did you ever rodeo?

218
00:10:49.608 --> 00:10:51.110
- I was a calf roper.

219
00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:52.068
- Still rope?

220
00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.697
- No, that was a long time ago.

221
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.323
- [Donna] Oh don't
let him fool you.

222
00:10:56.407 --> 00:10:59.285
He can still throw a rope
with the best of them.

223
00:10:59.368 --> 00:11:00.618
- Chris, before we eat--

224
00:11:00.703 --> 00:11:02.037
- Oh of course, I'd
love to say grace.

225
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.122
- Oh but we still--

226
00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:05.498
- Dear Heavenly Father,

227
00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.835
please bless this
food we have here.

228
00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:09.628
- Hey.
(playful music)

229
00:11:09.712 --> 00:11:10.713
- Oh.

230
00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:14.050
(Christian coughs)

231
00:11:14.133 --> 00:11:15.550
Dear Heavenly Father,

232
00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:16.385
please bless this food.

233
00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:19.263
(playful music)

234
00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.643
Dear Heavenly Father,

235
00:11:25.728 --> 00:11:28.938
(playful music)

236
00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.065
dear Heavenly Father,

237
00:11:31.067 --> 00:11:32.150
please bless this--

238
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.570
(playful music)

239
00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:36.113
- Sorry, no, go on.

240
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:38.282
- Dear Lord,

241
00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:44.747
please bless this food
to the nourishment

242
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.873
of our bodies, amen.

243
00:11:45.957 --> 00:11:47.792
- [All] Amen.

244
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:49.042
- [Lisa] Amen!

245
00:11:50.962 --> 00:11:52.547
- That's right, Chris.

246
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:53.963
You haven't met our
daughters, have you?

247
00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:57.050
This is May, Lauren, April,

248
00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:58.927
Clair and Lisa.

249
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.345
And this is Chris.

250
00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.307
So Chris, you say
you're a chaplain.

251
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.683
- Yes, sir, I am,

252
00:12:04.767 --> 00:12:08.228
Rincon Valley Christian
College, in California.

253
00:12:08.312 --> 00:12:09.355
- Did you say California?

254
00:12:09.438 --> 00:12:11.148
- How close are
you to the beach?

255
00:12:11.232 --> 00:12:12.483
- About an hour.

256
00:12:12.567 --> 00:12:14.110
- I would love to
live at the beach.

257
00:12:14.193 --> 00:12:15.402
- Do you know any movie stars?

258
00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.362
- Oh like that one
guy from that show.

259
00:12:17.447 --> 00:12:18.905
- Oh, I love that guy.

260
00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.532
- He's so dreamy.

261
00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.535
- He's California dreamy.

262
00:12:22.618 --> 00:12:24.412
- Do you have coyotes in LA?

263
00:12:24.495 --> 00:12:25.830
- Or bobcats?

264
00:12:25.913 --> 00:12:26.913
- Tarantulas?

265
00:12:26.997 --> 00:12:28.123
- Scorpions?

266
00:12:28.207 --> 00:12:30.583
- Rattlesnakes, chuk-chuk-chuk?

267
00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.210
- All right, now you're
starting to get scary.

268
00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.255
- They can get in your boots.

269
00:12:34.338 --> 00:12:36.173
- Well, good think
I ain't wearing any.

270
00:12:36.257 --> 00:12:38.342
But California's really not
too much different than here,

271
00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.093
more cactus here,
and it's hotter.

272
00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:41.553
But it's a dry heat, right?

273
00:12:41.637 --> 00:12:43.222
- Oh, oh it's a dry heat.

274
00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:44.515
Tell that to the turkey

275
00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:46.558
when you stick him
in the oven, right?

276
00:12:46.642 --> 00:12:49.645
(all laugh)

277
00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:52.272
- Yeah, and there's
all the stables here.

278
00:12:53.065 --> 00:12:54.858
We got all this land out here.

279
00:12:56.402 --> 00:12:58.362
So, my boy, should I
show you the bunkhouse,

280
00:12:58.445 --> 00:12:59.738
or should I call you a cab?

281
00:12:59.822 --> 00:13:02.240
- (chuckles) Well, as much fun

282
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.408
as this had been, Mr Miller...

283
00:13:03.492 --> 00:13:05.828
(gentle music)

284
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.670
- How was your ride, honey?

285
00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.297
- There's a section of
fence over on the west side

286
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.423
that needs to be looked at.

287
00:13:18.507 --> 00:13:20.050
- [Tom] Oh, okay.

288
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.677
- I'll get Ray and Zeke on it
first thing in the morning.

289
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.887
- All right, well, there's
some chili in the bunkhouse,

290
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.055
if you're hungry.

291
00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:26.182
- Nope, I'm good.

292
00:13:26.265 --> 00:13:27.182
I had something already.

293
00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:28.475
- All right, good, good.

294
00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.437
Well, Amy, this is
Mr Christian Andrews.

295
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.605
Chris, this is my oldest, Amy.

296
00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.273
Chris is a friend of Tim's.

297
00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:37.527
- How do you do?

298
00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.028
I'll take Jubilee
to the stables.

299
00:13:40.112 --> 00:13:40.988
- [Tom] All right.

300
00:13:41.072 --> 00:13:43.823
(Amy clicks)
(Jubilee grunts)

301
00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:46.910
(gentle music)

302
00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:50.455
So, Chris, you were saying?

303
00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:55.168
- Well, if it's not
putting you out.

304
00:13:55.252 --> 00:13:57.713
(Tom laughs)

305
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.720
- So do you all of
your daughters help

306
00:14:04.803 --> 00:14:05.888
with you on the ranch?

307
00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:08.140
- Yeah, they each have

308
00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:10.308
their own responsibilities
and duties.

309
00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:13.353
Donna and I have been
doing this a lot of years,

310
00:14:13.437 --> 00:14:16.148
and we're just not as
spry as we used to be.

311
00:14:16.232 --> 00:14:18.567
Amy Grace, she's our right hand.

312
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.320
(solemn music)

313
00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:27.158
Some of the comforts of home.

314
00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:30.913
I miss that young man.

315
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.500
Just when you think you've got
your whole life figured out.

316
00:14:36.502 --> 00:14:38.712
- Nobody's promised
tomorrow, are they?

317
00:14:40.047 --> 00:14:42.298
- Well, make yourself at home.

318
00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:45.385
This is, this was Tim's room.

319
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.512
- I appreciate it, thank you.

320
00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:49.390
- We're up at dawn.

321
00:14:50.307 --> 00:14:52.727
(solemn music)

322
00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:10.410
(crickets chirping)

323
00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:26.760
(animal howling)
(owl hooting)

324
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.723
(creature rattling)

325
00:15:32.683 --> 00:15:35.852
(ominous music)

326
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:36.728
- Nuh-uh.

327
00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:50.242
(animal howling)
(suspenseful music)

328
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.170
(solemn music)

329
00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:03.672
- All rise.

330
00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:07.633
State of Arizona
versus Ray Hawkins

331
00:16:07.718 --> 00:16:10.553
and Zeke Montano
is now in session,

332
00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:12.305
Judge Stone presiding.

333
00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:13.140
- Be seated.

334
00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:18.187
And take those cowboy hats
off in this courtroom.

335
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.355
I don't care if
you're in Arizona.

336
00:16:19.438 --> 00:16:21.482
And you should know better.

337
00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:25.985
You boys have been in my
courtroom way too many times

338
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.947
over the last few years.

339
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.782
You're way past
the three strikes.

340
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.868
Mr Prosecutor, you
want to proceed?

341
00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:37.455
- Your Honor,

342
00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:43.295
Mr Hawkins is charged
with disorderly behavior

343
00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:47.048
and public drunkenness
and a brawl

344
00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:50.260
that allegedly was
instigated by Mr Hawkins

345
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:53.847
and his accomplice,
Zeke Montoyo.

346
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.558
They caused the
destruction of a pool cue

347
00:16:57.517 --> 00:17:01.105
and one overhead Coca-Cola lamp.

348
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:03.982
Now Your Honor,

349
00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:08.778
I am not saying that these
are the worst criminals

350
00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:13.700
in the world, but they
are repeat offenders

351
00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:17.662
with no regard for society.

352
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.835
I say we should throw
the book at them.

353
00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.045
(Ray and Zeke whispering)

354
00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:26.255
(gavel bangs)

355
00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:28.132
- Quiet, quiet in my courtroom!

356
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.383
Mr Gray?

357
00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:34.053
- Oh, oh (coughs).

358
00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:34.888
Yes, Your Honor,

359
00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:37.515
(quirky music)

360
00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:40.393
my client, Mr, uh,

361
00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:43.105
(quirky music)

362
00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:49.068
Ray Hawkins, and my other
client, Zeke Montano,

363
00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:51.863
have been arrested 22,

364
00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:56.368
22?

365
00:17:57.828 --> 00:18:00.455
Have been arrested
22 times, Your Honor.

366
00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:04.000
So we are requesting leniency.

367
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:05.835
- I object.

368
00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.712
- Wait, wait, wait, it's okay.

369
00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:10.590
You boys have some
pretty good friends

370
00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:12.300
over there at the Eight Ball.

371
00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:15.803
They're willing to drop
the destruction of property

372
00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:17.763
if you pay $1,200
in restitution.

373
00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:22.060
- My clients agree to full
restitution, Your Honor.

374
00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:23.312
- I object.

375
00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:24.980
I don't have that kind of money.

376
00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:26.022
I didn't agree to this.

377
00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.358
- They are both
gainfully employed,

378
00:18:28.442 --> 00:18:31.110
more than happy to pay
restitution, Your Honor.

379
00:18:31.195 --> 00:18:33.447
- (chuckles) That
only leaves the charge

380
00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:34.990
of public drunkenness.

381
00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:37.993
Mr Hawkins, I'm gonna
order you to do three days

382
00:18:38.077 --> 00:18:40.787
of AA meetings over
the next 30 days.

383
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.498
After which time, you
will report back to me.

384
00:18:43.582 --> 00:18:46.377
Take advantage of this,
or you'll get jail time.

385
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.335
- Three AA meetings?

386
00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:49.003
Judge, I can't do that.

387
00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:50.588
And that's the truth.

388
00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:51.590
- Oh, three days too much?

389
00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:52.925
How about five?

390
00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.552
- Judge, you can't do that.

391
00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:55.343
- Oh, I can't?

392
00:18:55.427 --> 00:18:56.345
You wanna go for 10?

393
00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:59.430
Keep it going.

394
00:18:59.515 --> 00:19:02.350
365, I got days, come on.

395
00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:06.522
Didn't think so.

396
00:19:08.357 --> 00:19:09.817
Get 'em out of my courtroom!

397
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.403
- Should've taken the three.

398
00:19:13.487 --> 00:19:14.237
- [Judge] Now!

399
00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:15.822
(gavel bangs)

400
00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.367
(solemn music)

401
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.128
(engines rev)

402
00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:35.592
- City slicker.

403
00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:38.053
(Ray spits)

404
00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.602
(solemn music)

405
00:19:54.485 --> 00:19:55.278
- Thanks, Tim.

406
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.032
(solemn music)

407
00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:17.258
(horse snorts)

408
00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:18.093
All right.

409
00:20:31.273 --> 00:20:32.065
Hey, ladies.

410
00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:35.277
I thought I'd come by, see if
I could help out around here

411
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.362
with some, some ranch things.

412
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.700
(bell rings)

413
00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:43.202
- Well, you're a little late.

414
00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:44.493
It's lunch.

415
00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.580
- Oh, okay, guys.

416
00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:48.123
- If you want, you can finish up

417
00:20:48.207 --> 00:20:51.460
with the rest of the
stables after we eat.

418
00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:53.378
- Yeah, I can do that.

419
00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:55.338
- Deal.

420
00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:58.508
- Cool.

421
00:20:58.592 --> 00:21:01.260
(horse neighs)

422
00:21:02.553 --> 00:21:03.305
No.

423
00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:09.602
(sighs) Welcome to
the ranch, I guess.

424
00:21:09.687 --> 00:21:12.522
(triangle chimes)

425
00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:15.067
(gentle music)

426
00:21:19.697 --> 00:21:21.907
Just right on there.

427
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.740
Thank you.

428
00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:43.178
(Christian sighs)

429
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.973
Nice day.
- You too.

430
00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:50.768
(solemn music)

431
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.563
- Round here, we
usually do a little work

432
00:21:53.647 --> 00:21:55.107
before we eat.

433
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.525
(solemn music)

434
00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:03.573
Ah, just kidding, too slow.

435
00:22:03.657 --> 00:22:06.075
(solemn music)

436
00:22:09.955 --> 00:22:11.288
- Lauren, you finished
with the tack room?

437
00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:12.082
- Two more.

438
00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:13.292
- Good.

439
00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:14.625
Clair and May, you're on
dinner detail tonight.

440
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.752
Menu's in the kitchen.

441
00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:17.378
April, Lisa, finish
mucking the stables.

442
00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:19.715
- Uh, Mr Andrews
said that he'd like

443
00:22:19.798 --> 00:22:21.132
to finish up with the stables.

444
00:22:23.302 --> 00:22:25.178
- Is this true?

445
00:22:25.262 --> 00:22:27.388
- Sure, I got to earn
my lunch somehow, right?

446
00:22:27.472 --> 00:22:28.223
I was walking around.

447
00:22:28.307 --> 00:22:29.015
They were working, and--

448
00:22:29.098 --> 00:22:30.058
- Well, Mr Andrews,

449
00:22:30.142 --> 00:22:31.225
I think you should know
these two are trying

450
00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:32.393
to pull something over on you.

451
00:22:32.477 --> 00:22:33.770
There are a lot more stables

452
00:22:33.853 --> 00:22:35.147
on the other side of this ranch.

453
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.690
- How many we talkin'?

454
00:22:36.773 --> 00:22:38.442
- About another 30.

455
00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:39.735
- I'm up for that.

456
00:22:39.818 --> 00:22:41.235
- You know, with these two,

457
00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:42.820
they were lookin' at
another half day of work.

458
00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:43.780
- I'll honor my commitment.

459
00:22:43.863 --> 00:22:45.157
- Fine.

460
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.032
Ray and Zeke can show you what

461
00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:47.783
to do when you get there.

462
00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:50.037
Clair, please show Mr
Andrews where to go

463
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.330
on your way to
exercise the horses.

464
00:22:52.413 --> 00:22:53.665
The rest of you get goin'.

465
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.212
You two, you come with me.

466
00:22:58.295 --> 00:22:59.212
Find something
else for you to do

467
00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:00.797
for the rest of the afternoon.

468
00:23:03.133 --> 00:23:05.468
- [Clair] So you went
to school with Tim?

469
00:23:05.552 --> 00:23:06.428
- [Christian] We
were best friends

470
00:23:06.512 --> 00:23:08.012
when we were about your age.

471
00:23:08.097 --> 00:23:10.473
- [Clair] Hard to
imagine Tim being my age.

472
00:23:10.557 --> 00:23:12.100
- [Christian] Why is that?

473
00:23:12.183 --> 00:23:14.560
- [Clair] He always seemed
so serious about everything.

474
00:23:14.643 --> 00:23:15.853
- Anything else I need to
know about Ray and Zeke?

475
00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:17.855
- Do you like to drink a lot?

476
00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:18.648
- No.

477
00:23:18.732 --> 00:23:19.858
- You ever been to jail?

478
00:23:19.942 --> 00:23:21.192
- No.

479
00:23:21.275 --> 00:23:23.403
- You guys won't have
much to talk about then.

480
00:23:23.487 --> 00:23:25.947
- Ray gets the brown bottle
flu every month or two.

481
00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.282
- What is that?

482
00:23:27.365 --> 00:23:28.575
- He has a little
too much to drink

483
00:23:28.658 --> 00:23:30.910
and spends the weekend in jail.

484
00:23:30.993 --> 00:23:33.413
Oh, and they know a city
slicker when they see one.

485
00:23:35.248 --> 00:23:37.917
(solemn music)

486
00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:44.883
Hey, guys, Mr Chris
volunteered to finish up

487
00:23:44.967 --> 00:23:48.845
with the stables, so maybe
you could show him what to do.

488
00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:51.598
- Oh, uh, we can point him
in the right direction.

489
00:23:51.682 --> 00:23:54.600
(solemn music)

490
00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:55.477
- I'm Christian.

491
00:23:57.728 --> 00:23:58.897
Okay.

492
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.565
- So you were a friend of Tim's?

493
00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:01.650
- I was, yes.

494
00:24:02.525 --> 00:24:03.652
- Hard to believe.

495
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.697
Got a lot more cowboy
in him than you.

496
00:24:08.282 --> 00:24:09.908
- He knew how to
pull his own weight.

497
00:24:09.992 --> 00:24:11.493
- Guys, I'm just here to help.

498
00:24:11.577 --> 00:24:12.493
- Oh, you want to help?

499
00:24:12.577 --> 00:24:14.078
Hold this.

500
00:24:14.162 --> 00:24:16.080
Now have a PhD in muckology.

501
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.333
Here's the muck.

502
00:24:19.417 --> 00:24:21.335
- Hey, Professor, the
muck goes over there.

503
00:24:22.128 --> 00:24:24.882
(solemn music)

504
00:24:27.758 --> 00:24:30.220
(horse neighs)

505
00:24:40.688 --> 00:24:43.650
- You know, you don't
have anything to prove.

506
00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:44.775
- Hey.

507
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.402
I'm just getting my second wind.

508
00:24:48.363 --> 00:24:49.907
- You know, I can have
Ray and Zeke finish up

509
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.907
with these in the morning.

510
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.700
- No, no, I got this.

511
00:24:52.783 --> 00:24:54.660
(gentle music)

512
00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:56.913
- You're a very interesting
man, Mr Andrews,

513
00:24:57.955 --> 00:25:00.917
either crazy determined
or just plain crazy.

514
00:25:02.043 --> 00:25:04.128
- You know, I won't
use your last name

515
00:25:04.212 --> 00:25:05.588
if you don't use mine.

516
00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:10.510
- Good night, then, Mr, Chris.

517
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.722
(gentle music)

518
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.225
- I'm interesting.

519
00:25:20.312 --> 00:25:21.103
Or I'm crazy.

520
00:25:22.188 --> 00:25:24.857
(gentle music)

521
00:25:26.902 --> 00:25:30.155
(upbeat country music)

522
00:25:34.617 --> 00:25:37.370
(horse neighs)

523
00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:44.752
(Christian coughs)

524
00:25:44.835 --> 00:25:47.338
(horse neighs)

525
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.428
(all laugh)

526
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:00.560
- All right.

527
00:26:01.185 --> 00:26:02.437
Let's get back to it.

528
00:26:03.397 --> 00:26:04.855

00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:10.755
- Oh.

545
00:27:10.838 --> 00:27:13.425
(horse grunts)

546
00:27:14.925 --> 00:27:15.968
Asprin?

547
00:27:16.052 --> 00:27:17.470
Oh, thank you.

548
00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:21.015
(gentle music)

549
00:27:21.098 --> 00:27:22.517
- You may want to take one more.

550
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:31.275
(horse grunts)
(Christian sighs)

551
00:27:34.362 --> 00:27:38.282
- (sighs) I am
hurtin' in places--

552
00:27:38.367 --> 00:27:39.658
- [Amy] Me, too.

553
00:27:39.742 --> 00:27:41.327
- Hey, Amy, you got a
couple of horses loose

554
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:42.328
on the north fence.

555
00:27:42.412 --> 00:27:43.955
Can you get 'em for me?

556
00:27:44.038 --> 00:27:44.955
- Yeah, I got it.

557
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.582
- Oh, and take Chris with ya.

558
00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:47.417
- But...

559
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.882
(gentle music)

560
00:28:02.432 --> 00:28:04.100
- [Christian] Here's
the horses are,

561
00:28:06.978 --> 00:28:08.688
just around the wire.

562
00:28:12.692 --> 00:28:14.110
All right.

563
00:28:14.193 --> 00:28:14.985
Hey.

564
00:28:17.488 --> 00:28:18.907
How you doin' there?

565
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.367
(gentle music)

566
00:28:28.332 --> 00:28:31.878
(Christian grunts)

567
00:28:31.962 --> 00:28:33.713
- Give me your phone.

568
00:28:33.797 --> 00:28:34.547
- Huh?

569
00:28:36.298 --> 00:28:37.092
Okay.

570
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:45.392
- Here's my info.

571
00:28:46.852 --> 00:28:49.937
You feeling too sore to
work tomorrow, just text me.

572
00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.940
- (chuckles) I'll
be all right, okay,

573
00:28:52.023 --> 00:28:53.065
in about a week.

574
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.568
- If you find
yourself in a hole,

575
00:28:56.652 --> 00:28:58.195
first thing to do
is stop digging.

576
00:28:58.278 --> 00:28:59.655
Will Rogers.

577
00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:01.490
- I don't think that was a
hole I was digging today.

578
00:29:01.573 --> 00:29:03.325
(Amy chuckles)

579
00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:05.203
- Stop trying to
be a ranch hand.

580
00:29:06.162 --> 00:29:08.372
Believe me, you're never
gonna be a ranch hand.

581
00:29:09.832 --> 00:29:11.167
Just be Chris Andrews.

582
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.338
I don't need another ranch hand.

583
00:29:15.422 --> 00:29:16.130
Come on.

584
00:29:16.213 --> 00:29:18.592
(gentle music)

585
00:29:42.282 --> 00:29:45.160
- My friend, Tim,
I can't believe

586
00:29:45.243 --> 00:29:47.495
how fast our high school
years have flown by.

587
00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:50.457
As we embark on this
next phase of our lives,

588
00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.458
I hope we will continue
to remain best friends,

589
00:29:54.377 --> 00:29:56.420
even if we go in
separate directions.

590
00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:00.508
As long as we hold
Christ in our hearts

591
00:30:00.592 --> 00:30:03.637
and surround ourselves
with those who believe,

592
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.932
we'll always be part
of the Faith Club.

593
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.725
Your friend, Christian.

594
00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:13.187
(Christian chuckles)

595
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.230
Why did you keep this?

596
00:30:15.607 --> 00:30:18.067
(gentle music)

597
00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:22.988
(people chattering)

598
00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:29.453
- His mighty firmament.

599
00:30:29.537 --> 00:30:31.038
(knocking)

600
00:30:31.122 --> 00:30:32.498
Uh, one second.

601
00:30:36.127 --> 00:30:37.878
Yes.

602
00:30:37.962 --> 00:30:40.047
- Mr Jones, there's about
a dozen college students

603
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.507
waiting here to see you.

604
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.552
- Okay, uh, just
give me a minute.

605
00:30:44.552 --> 00:30:46.053
- Are you okay?

606
00:30:46.137 --> 00:30:47.263
- [Rick] Oh yeah.

607
00:30:49.473 --> 00:30:52.060
(tense music)

608
00:30:54.228 --> 00:30:56.313
(phone chimes)

609
00:30:56.397 --> 00:30:57.315
- Oh.

610
00:30:57.398 --> 00:30:58.942
Amy?

611
00:30:59.025 --> 00:30:59.733
Amy, Amy.

612
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.278
(groans) Rick.

613
00:31:03.738 --> 00:31:05.282
What's up, Rick?

614
00:31:05.365 --> 00:31:06.908
- Dude, when are
you getting back?

615
00:31:08.075 --> 00:31:09.660
- I'm not sure yet, actually.

616
00:31:10.537 --> 00:31:12.497
- Well, I'm, I'm drowning here.

617
00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.413
I've got like 20
kids who want me

618
00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:14.207
to give them my advice.

619
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:15.833
My advice!

620
00:31:15.917 --> 00:31:18.920
- Just listen and let God
guide you to the answers.

621
00:31:19.003 --> 00:31:19.837
- Now that easy for you.

622
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.880
I'm not very good at listening.

623
00:31:21.965 --> 00:31:22.840
- Just have faith.

624
00:31:22.923 --> 00:31:24.925
I won't be here much longer.

625
00:31:25.008 --> 00:31:26.677
- What, I got to do
another Sunday service?

626
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.928
- You'll do great, okay.

627
00:31:28.012 --> 00:31:29.597
I have faith in you.

628
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.850
Just please don't
use the Prius story.

629
00:31:32.933 --> 00:31:34.810
I'll call you as soon
as I know something.

630
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.480
- All right, hey,

631
00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:40.775
what's wrong with
the Prius story?

632
00:31:40.858 --> 00:31:42.318
Chris, hello?

633
00:31:46.197 --> 00:31:47.865
(Rick sighs)

634
00:31:47.948 --> 00:31:49.158
God, help me through this.

635
00:31:49.242 --> 00:31:51.910
(dramatic music)

636
00:32:05.633 --> 00:32:06.383
- Hey, Chris.

637
00:32:07.718 --> 00:32:08.720
Can you ride?

638
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.183
- Yes, yes, I can.

639
00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:17.020
- So you've ridden before?

640
00:32:17.103 --> 00:32:19.063
- No, no, I haven't.

641
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:20.607
- Okay, we'll hike.

642
00:32:29.073 --> 00:32:31.200
- Coach wants me to play
football this summer,

643
00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:32.368
and I don't want to.

644
00:32:32.452 --> 00:32:33.410
I'm done with that.

645
00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:35.037
I'm a baker,

646
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.457
doughnuts, strudels, pies.

647
00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.418
- I'm doing my
nails this weekend.

648
00:32:40.502 --> 00:32:42.170
Pink or gold?

649
00:32:42.253 --> 00:32:44.755
- Hey, I have seven brothers.

650
00:32:44.838 --> 00:32:47.008
It's not my fault he
can't take a punch.

651
00:32:48.802 --> 00:32:50.762
- Pastor, who do
I need to talk to

652
00:32:50.845 --> 00:32:52.305
to get some good
doughnuts and coffee

653
00:32:52.388 --> 00:32:53.765
in the faculty room, hmm?

654
00:32:54.973 --> 00:32:56.142
Hmm?

655
00:32:56.225 --> 00:32:58.643
(gentle music)

656
00:33:01.355 --> 00:33:04.067
- I thought you
could use a day off.

657
00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.152
- Don't think I deserve one.

658
00:33:06.235 --> 00:33:07.653
I think you're just
trying to keep me

659
00:33:07.737 --> 00:33:08.780
from wrecking something else.

660
00:33:08.863 --> 00:33:09.863
- My secret's out.

661
00:33:11.365 --> 00:33:13.868
April and Lisa sure
knew how to play you.

662
00:33:13.993 --> 00:33:16.453
- You know, I knew I
suspected something.

663
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.788
I really just wanted to help,

664
00:33:17.872 --> 00:33:20.750
but I did not expect
to wake up in a stable.

665
00:33:22.585 --> 00:33:24.128
- You're such a city slicker.

666
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.005
- So what'd you end
up doing with 'em?

667
00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.215
- Who?

668
00:33:28.298 --> 00:33:29.883
- Lisa and April.

669
00:33:29.967 --> 00:33:32.178
- I just made sure the
alternative was worse.

670
00:33:32.262 --> 00:33:33.847
- (laughs) How bad was it?

671
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.640
- Change and wash all the linens

672
00:33:35.723 --> 00:33:38.058
and clean all the
bedrooms and bathrooms.

673
00:33:38.142 --> 00:33:39.102
- That's kind of like
what I was doing.

674
00:33:39.185 --> 00:33:40.478
- I hope not.

675
00:33:40.562 --> 00:33:43.230
(gentle music)

676
00:33:45.065 --> 00:33:47.110
- Did you know Tim well?

677
00:33:47.193 --> 00:33:49.903
- No, he kept to himself.

678
00:33:49.987 --> 00:33:52.115
He was a good worker, though.

679
00:33:52.198 --> 00:33:54.325
I think Clair got to
know him the best.

680
00:33:54.408 --> 00:33:56.452
She took his death pretty hard.

681
00:33:56.535 --> 00:33:58.537
You may want to talk to her.

682
00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.038
- It'd probably be
good for both of us.

683
00:34:00.915 --> 00:34:02.917
- I don't think I could do that.

684
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.752
I'm not a very good listener.

685
00:34:04.835 --> 00:34:06.587
- Well, we all
got our strengths.

686
00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:07.380
You run a ranch.

687
00:34:07.463 --> 00:34:08.547
That's no easy task.

688
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.465
- I don't run this ranch.

689
00:34:10.132 --> 00:34:11.633
- You could've fooled me.

690
00:34:11.717 --> 00:34:13.677
- I don't work it alone.

691
00:34:13.762 --> 00:34:16.138
I do rather enjoy telling
people what to do, though.

692
00:34:16.222 --> 00:34:17.140
- That I've noticed.

693
00:34:17.223 --> 00:34:20.267
(both laugh)

694
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:21.352
- Let's go this way.

695
00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:25.690
(upbeat music)

696
00:34:25.773 --> 00:34:27.065
- So you know I'm head
of the cheerleading team.

697
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.525
Woo-woo!

698
00:34:28.608 --> 00:34:30.360
Any ideas for a new routine?

699
00:34:30.445 --> 00:34:31.737
- So I've been working out.

700
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:32.822
I adjusted my workout
to do a lot of curls.

701
00:34:32.905 --> 00:34:35.658
You think the coach will
let me back on the team?

702
00:34:35.742 --> 00:34:39.370
- I think I'm homesick (sobs).

703
00:34:43.332 --> 00:34:46.252
- I was trying to find a
great burger near campus.

704
00:34:46.335 --> 00:34:47.128
Any suggestions?

705
00:34:47.212 --> 00:34:48.963
- Now that I can help you with.

706
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.340
Hold all my calls.

707
00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:53.258
I'm goin' to lunch.

708
00:34:53.342 --> 00:34:55.762
(gentle music)

709
00:34:59.682 --> 00:35:02.017
- What is this place?

710
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.520
- All the old ranches have
these family cemeteries.

711
00:35:05.522 --> 00:35:07.190
This is the Miller
family cemetery.

712
00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:11.527
This one's an old cowboy
grave from the 1800s,

713
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:12.487
oldest one we've got.

714
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.822
Don't even know who he is.

715
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.000
This is the newest one.

716
00:35:26.917 --> 00:35:28.460
- Tim.

717
00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:29.212
- Yeah.

718
00:35:31.047 --> 00:35:33.007
Yeah, we had a service out
here a, couple of days ago.

719
00:35:34.592 --> 00:35:36.593
Looks like Ray and Zeke
made it out here, too.

720
00:35:37.637 --> 00:35:39.055
- I just got the news late.

721
00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:42.975
(somber music)

722
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.397
(Christian sniffs)

723
00:35:58.867 --> 00:36:03.370
- Tim, my friend,
what happened to you?

724
00:36:03.453 --> 00:36:05.957
(somber music)

725
00:36:19.012 --> 00:36:20.470
- I want you to meet my parents.

726
00:36:21.763 --> 00:36:23.390
- Your parents?

727
00:36:23.473 --> 00:36:24.683
I thought the
Millers were your--

728
00:36:24.767 --> 00:36:27.437
- They took me in after
my parents were killed.

729
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.980
The Miller's are
my aunt and uncle.

730
00:36:30.063 --> 00:36:32.065
- What happened?

731
00:36:32.148 --> 00:36:33.317
- It was five years ago.

732
00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.443
They were a block
down the street

733
00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:36.778
and got hit by a drunk driver.

734
00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:39.990
Dead at the scene.

735
00:36:42.993 --> 00:36:44.495
- What about the other driver?

736
00:36:44.578 --> 00:36:45.245
- Barely a scratch.

737
00:36:49.042 --> 00:36:51.377
- Did he go to prison or--

738
00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.837
- Not one day.

739
00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:56.257
Case got thrown out
on a technicality.

740
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.883
They lost the
blood alcohol test.

741
00:36:59.427 --> 00:37:00.552
I've moved on.

742
00:37:02.012 --> 00:37:04.390
I don't want to know
anything about him.

743
00:37:04.473 --> 00:37:06.558
I feel like it gives him
power over me, you know.

744
00:37:06.642 --> 00:37:07.643
- Hmm.

745
00:37:09.187 --> 00:37:10.395
To lose your parents, I,

746
00:37:11.688 --> 00:37:12.690
I can't imagine.

747
00:37:12.773 --> 00:37:15.192
(somber music)

748
00:37:23.367 --> 00:37:25.620
(gentle music)

749
00:37:25.703 --> 00:37:28.455
(Christian sighs)

750
00:37:32.293 --> 00:37:34.212
(Christian chuckles)

751
00:37:34.295 --> 00:37:35.128
- Are you serious?

752
00:37:36.547 --> 00:37:37.340
Thanks, Tim.

753
00:37:41.927 --> 00:37:42.803
There you go.

754
00:37:42.887 --> 00:37:44.513
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

755
00:37:45.765 --> 00:37:47.517
- [Tom] I'm really glad you're
spending some time here.

756
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.143
- Yeah, you know,

757
00:37:49.227 --> 00:37:50.770
I really think it's
just what I needed.

758
00:37:50.853 --> 00:37:53.480
- Yeah, sunshine and hard
work can really be healing.

759
00:37:54.523 --> 00:37:55.565
- Amen to that.

760
00:37:56.983 --> 00:37:58.693
- Hey, how well
did you know Tim?

761
00:38:00.112 --> 00:38:01.863
- What do you want to know?

762
00:38:01.947 --> 00:38:03.240
- I don't know.

763
00:38:03.323 --> 00:38:04.867
It's the way everybody
talks about Tim here.

764
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.870
It's just different than the
way I knew him, you know.

765
00:38:07.953 --> 00:38:09.705
And no offense, I
love this ranch.

766
00:38:10.998 --> 00:38:14.377
But I just can't really see
him doing a job like this.

767
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.087
- Well, you know, sometimes
people are working at something,

768
00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.798
and sometimes they're
working on something.

769
00:38:21.258 --> 00:38:22.510
- Was he happy here?

770
00:38:23.177 --> 00:38:25.387
- Was Tim happy?

771
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:28.765
I like to think he was
finding some satisfaction

772
00:38:28.848 --> 00:38:30.727
in what he was doing here.

773
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.143
You know, he'd been
through a lot in life

774
00:38:32.227 --> 00:38:34.147
since you and he
knew each other.

775
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.605
- I just lost contact with him.

776
00:38:36.773 --> 00:38:38.567
I got busy, too busy.

777
00:38:42.405 --> 00:38:45.198
- Well, you know,
we can't do anything

778
00:38:45.282 --> 00:38:46.575
about what's come and gone.

779
00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:49.203
All we can do is learn
from our mistakes.

780
00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.955
- That's words of wisdom.

781
00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:54.417
- (laughs) I've got over 30
years of mistakes on you.

782
00:38:56.127 --> 00:38:58.712
Hey, by the way, Donna and
I are gonna be leaving town

783
00:38:58.795 --> 00:39:00.338
the day after tomorrow.

784
00:39:00.422 --> 00:39:03.050
I was hoping you'd still
be here when we get back.

785
00:39:03.133 --> 00:39:04.593
We'll only be gone
a couple of days.

786
00:39:06.303 --> 00:39:07.805
- Okay.

787
00:39:07.888 --> 00:39:08.972
- And Amy's gonna
be running things,

788
00:39:09.057 --> 00:39:11.558
which she does anyway.

789
00:39:11.642 --> 00:39:12.810
If you could give her a hand

790
00:39:12.893 --> 00:39:14.228
with whatever she
needs help with,

791
00:39:14.312 --> 00:39:15.145
I'd appreciate it.

792
00:39:16.647 --> 00:39:19.400
- I don't know how much
help I'll be, but, uh, sure.

793
00:39:19.483 --> 00:39:22.110
(gentle music)

794
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.115
- We won't be gone very
long, just a few days.

795
00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:29.160
We'll tell you all about
it when we get home.

796
00:39:29.243 --> 00:39:30.745
- Can I go?

797
00:39:30.828 --> 00:39:32.538
- No, I'm sorry, sweetie.

798
00:39:32.622 --> 00:39:33.872
- Now we expect all of you

799
00:39:33.955 --> 00:39:35.457
to give Amy the same
respect you give us

800
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.083
while we're gone.

801
00:39:37.167 --> 00:39:39.962
- Mm-hmm, and try to make
sure that guy doesn't starve

802
00:39:40.045 --> 00:39:41.797
to death while we're gone, okay.

803
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.342
(gentle music)

804
00:39:55.518 --> 00:39:58.855
- Tim spent a lot of time
out here the last few months.

805
00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:01.067
- So were you two
listening to Johnny Cash?

806
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.942
- Yeah.

807
00:40:02.025 --> 00:40:03.777
- And what's all this?

808
00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:04.862
- I don't know.

809
00:40:04.945 --> 00:40:09.700
- Whoa.

810
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.868
Whoa.

811
00:40:11.952 --> 00:40:13.037
- [Clair] What is it?

812
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.455
- It's, uh, stuff.

813
00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:19.460
A little book over here, too.

814
00:40:22.672 --> 00:40:23.922
Oh my goodness.

815
00:40:28.052 --> 00:40:31.972
Tim and I, back then, we
were just on fire for Jesus.

816
00:40:32.055 --> 00:40:33.848
So I went to a
Christian college,

817
00:40:33.932 --> 00:40:35.308
became a chaplain there, right.

818
00:40:37.478 --> 00:40:40.313
He only went one semester,
dropped out, got a job.

819
00:40:41.315 --> 00:40:43.358
I hadn't talked
to him since then.

820
00:40:44.402 --> 00:40:47.278
This looks like an outline
to fix this place up.

821
00:40:47.362 --> 00:40:48.947
He never told you
anything about this?

822
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:50.825
- No, they used to talk about

823
00:40:50.908 --> 00:40:53.077
how they had dances out
here in the old days.

824
00:40:55.245 --> 00:40:57.455
- He was thinking about
doing services here.

825
00:40:58.290 --> 00:40:59.250
- Like a church?

826
00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.548
- Hmm?

827
00:41:10.135 --> 00:41:12.680
(dramatic music)

828
00:41:16.975 --> 00:41:18.393
Maybe this is why I'm here,

829
00:41:19.102 --> 00:41:20.897
to finish what Tim started here.

830
00:41:23.565 --> 00:41:25.150
I think I know who could help.

has been at a ranch

843
00:42:16.743 --> 00:42:19.247
in Tucson all this time.

844
00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:20.915
- Never figured him
for a country boy.

845
00:42:22.165 --> 00:42:23.500
- How'd he end up here?

846
00:42:23.583 --> 00:42:26.628
- You guys, I want
your help, all right.

847
00:42:26.712 --> 00:42:28.255
I found out Tim had a vision.

848
00:42:28.338 --> 00:42:31.342
He wanted to start some
kind of cowboy church here

849
00:42:31.425 --> 00:42:32.968
on this ranch, you
know, a place for people

850
00:42:33.052 --> 00:42:34.345
to come who wouldn't
feel comfortable

851
00:42:34.428 --> 00:42:36.555
in a traditional church setting.

852
00:42:37.723 --> 00:42:40.850
The thing is, his first service
was set for next Sunday.

853
00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.020
- This isn't a church.

854
00:42:43.103 --> 00:42:45.355
It's a concrete slab.

855
00:42:45.438 --> 00:42:48.650
- I don't know, you
know, a few lights,

856
00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:50.318
chairs facing this
way, pulpit here.

857
00:42:50.402 --> 00:42:52.153
- Cowboy cathedral.

858
00:42:52.237 --> 00:42:54.030
- This cowboy wants
some air conditioning.

859
00:42:54.113 --> 00:42:55.448
- Come on, guys.

860
00:42:55.532 --> 00:42:56.617
Let's do this for Tim.

861
00:42:57.575 --> 00:42:59.787
- We are the Faith
Club, after all.

862
00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:00.828
- That's right.

863
00:43:01.872 --> 00:43:03.165
- I don't know.

864
00:43:03.248 --> 00:43:05.083
- Come on, man, you
got to have faith

865
00:43:05.167 --> 00:43:08.045
in God, the Faith
Club, faith in Tim.

866
00:43:09.087 --> 00:43:10.588
- Do you have faith or not?

867
00:43:10.672 --> 00:43:12.090
- Yeah, faith this is
gonna take more effort

868
00:43:12.173 --> 00:43:13.717
than we mentioned
over the phone.

869
00:43:14.677 --> 00:43:17.763
- Amy, I want you
to meet my friends,

870
00:43:17.847 --> 00:43:20.223
Maria, Donovan, Justin.

871
00:43:20.307 --> 00:43:21.558
Guys, this is Amy.

872
00:43:21.642 --> 00:43:23.560
- Hey, well, Maria,
we have a room

873
00:43:23.643 --> 00:43:25.062
at the house you can stay in.

874
00:43:25.145 --> 00:43:26.563
- Okay.

875
00:43:26.647 --> 00:43:28.190
- Okay if the guys
bunk with you, Chris?

876
00:43:28.273 --> 00:43:30.442
- Yeah, unless you guys want
to sleep in the stables.

877
00:43:30.525 --> 00:43:32.653
I just cleaned those
up the other day.

878
00:43:32.737 --> 00:43:33.570
- Well, meet us up at the house

879
00:43:33.653 --> 00:43:34.572
once you're settled in, okay.

880
00:43:34.655 --> 00:43:35.780
Come on.

881
00:43:35.863 --> 00:43:38.533
(gentle music)

882
00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:41.203
- Amy.

883
00:43:43.247 --> 00:43:45.040
- It's not like that.

884
00:43:45.123 --> 00:43:46.625
- Oh it's like that.

885
00:43:46.708 --> 00:43:49.127
(gentle music)

886
00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.467
- These are just a
few stables over here.

887
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:57.177
There's about 40 more stables
on the other side over there.

888
00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.053
- Dang.

889
00:43:58.137 --> 00:43:59.388
That's a lot of horses.

890
00:43:59.472 --> 00:44:00.388
- A whole lot of horse--

891
00:44:00.472 --> 00:44:02.265
- Oh, you're tellin' me.

892
00:44:02.348 --> 00:44:05.227
I spent a whole week shoveling
out stables one afternoon.

893
00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:08.688
(solemn music)

894
00:44:08.772 --> 00:44:13.443
- (laughs) Hey, Ray, looks
like you roped a hefer.

895
00:44:13.527 --> 00:44:15.112
- Yeah, it looks like
we got a few more hands

896
00:44:15.195 --> 00:44:16.697
to help clean out the stall.

897
00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.448
- Yeah, we were just talking
about that, actually.

898
00:44:18.532 --> 00:44:20.700
These are my buddies,
Justin and Donovan.

899
00:44:20.783 --> 00:44:21.785
- Come on, Zeke.

900
00:44:22.912 --> 00:44:25.538
(engines rev)

901
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.208
- Those guys are jerks.

902
00:44:29.292 --> 00:44:30.210
Who do they think they are?

903
00:44:30.293 --> 00:44:32.087
- I want to ride an ATV.

904
00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:33.505
- Ah, they're just ranch hands.

905
00:44:33.588 --> 00:44:34.840
They like to give
me a hard time.

906
00:44:34.923 --> 00:44:35.882
They ride up.

907
00:44:35.965 --> 00:44:36.842
They mock me.

908
00:44:36.925 --> 00:44:38.260
And then they ride out.

909
00:44:38.343 --> 00:44:39.970
- (laughs) God molding
your character.

910
00:44:41.555 --> 00:44:43.348
- [Maria] This is perfect.

911
00:44:43.432 --> 00:44:44.767
- Much better than
the bunkhouse.

912
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:47.310
(Maria laughs)

913
00:44:48.145 --> 00:44:49.938
So you knew Timothy, too?

914
00:44:50.022 --> 00:44:53.442
- Yeah, Tim and Chris were best
friends back in high school.

915
00:44:53.525 --> 00:44:55.152
- They seem so different.

916
00:44:55.235 --> 00:44:56.487
Timothy was so quiet.

917
00:44:57.362 --> 00:44:58.488
I never got to know him well

918
00:44:58.572 --> 00:45:00.532
in the three years he was here.

919
00:45:00.615 --> 00:45:01.783
I've already gotten
to know Chris better

920
00:45:01.867 --> 00:45:03.952
in just the few
days he's been here.

921
00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:05.620
- Tim inspired us all.

922
00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:09.165
He was always up, never
afraid to step out on faith.

923
00:45:09.248 --> 00:45:11.127
You know, like they say you
got to get out of the boat

924
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:12.878
before you can walk
on water (chuckles).

925
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.547
(gentle music)

926
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:16.798
You like Chris?

927
00:45:17.382 --> 00:45:18.592
- Yeah, he's great.

928
00:45:20.218 --> 00:45:21.345
We're just friends.

929
00:45:25.932 --> 00:45:27.142
I don't know.

930
00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:28.810
- Chris is a great guy.

931
00:45:30.812 --> 00:45:33.940
- I just haven't been interested
in anyone in a long time.

932
00:45:34.942 --> 00:45:36.402
Well, the horses
are happy to see me.

933
00:45:36.485 --> 00:45:38.070
(Maria laughs)

934
00:45:38.153 --> 00:45:39.447
Let's get you settled.

935
00:45:40.947 --> 00:45:42.740
- Hanging out, just
like high school.

936
00:45:42.825 --> 00:45:43.950
- I know, man.

937
00:45:44.033 --> 00:45:45.118
I'm glad you guys are here.

938
00:45:45.202 --> 00:45:45.910
- Glad to be here, man.

939
00:45:45.993 --> 00:45:47.078
So what's up with Amy?

940
00:45:47.162 --> 00:45:48.413
You ask her out yet?

941
00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.040
- I'm, I'm just
getting to know her.

942
00:45:52.042 --> 00:45:53.627
- Carpe diem, my friend.

943
00:45:54.545 --> 00:45:56.755
- Well, we did go on a
nice hike the other day.

944
00:45:56.838 --> 00:45:57.755
- [Justin] Oh yeah?

945
00:45:58.632 --> 00:45:59.675
- To a cemetery.

946
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:03.887
- Ouch.
- Now that's a cheap date.

947
00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:07.098
(gentle music)

948
00:46:07.182 --> 00:46:10.143
(crickets chirping)

949
00:46:13.897 --> 00:46:16.065
- [Amy] What a beautiful night.

950
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:18.652
- All this fresh air, we
don't have that in LA.

951
00:46:18.735 --> 00:46:20.820
I don't think I've seen
so many stars before.

952
00:46:22.072 --> 00:46:23.657
I gotta say,

953
00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.993
I think the ranch life is
starting to grow on me.

954
00:46:27.077 --> 00:46:28.287
- Your friends are nice.

955
00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:30.913
You guys are hilarious together.

956
00:46:31.873 --> 00:46:33.500
- Yeah, Tim should
be here, though.

957
00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:36.295
- From the way you
guys talk about him,

958
00:46:36.378 --> 00:46:38.297
he seems like completely
different guy.

959
00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:42.968
- Yeah, honestly, all this makes
me miss him that much more.

960
00:46:43.052 --> 00:46:45.803
I can't help but feel like
I let him down, you know.

961
00:46:45.887 --> 00:46:49.223
I should've tried harder to
stay in contact with him.

962
00:46:49.307 --> 00:46:50.600
Yeah, I do wish, though,

963
00:46:50.683 --> 00:46:52.602
God would let me see
him just one last time.

964
00:46:53.687 --> 00:46:55.980
- You'll see him one day, right?

965
00:46:56.063 --> 00:46:57.232
- Hmm.

966
00:46:57.315 --> 00:46:58.525
You a believer, Amy?

967
00:47:00.318 --> 00:47:03.905
- My mom and dad were
Christians, so yeah.

968
00:47:03.988 --> 00:47:05.865
I was saved when I was twelve.

969
00:47:05.948 --> 00:47:08.118
My aunt and uncle,
they're good people, so.

970
00:47:08.702 --> 00:47:11.037
- Sunday Christians?

971
00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.288
- Sunday morning Christians.

972
00:47:13.332 --> 00:47:14.123
Me, too.

973
00:47:15.708 --> 00:47:17.668
- Yeah, well, God knows
what's in your heart.

974
00:47:18.628 --> 00:47:19.838
- It can be a scary
thought sometimes.

975
00:47:19.922 --> 00:47:22.382
(both laugh)

976
00:47:23.592 --> 00:47:26.052
- You want to go to dinner, Amy.

977
00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:27.428
- I'm not really hungry.

978
00:47:27.512 --> 00:47:28.263
- Not tonight.

979
00:47:30.307 --> 00:47:31.098
- Like on a date?

980
00:47:36.272 --> 00:47:37.272
Okay, Chris.

981
00:47:47.073 --> 00:47:50.827
- It looks like the stage
area goes over here,

982
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:52.328
and the pulpit goes there.

983
00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.958
And all of the chairs
go right back here.

984
00:47:57.042 --> 00:47:59.293
- We could string
lights all over.

985
00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:00.087
That would be pretty.

986
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:02.130
- That sounds great.

987
00:48:02.213 --> 00:48:04.592
- Okay, okay, let's get back
to the important question here.

988
00:48:04.675 --> 00:48:05.758
Where are you taking
Amy for your date?

989
00:48:05.842 --> 00:48:07.677
- What, you asked
her out on a date?

990
00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.553
- It's just dinner
tomorrow night.

991
00:48:09.638 --> 00:48:11.515
- And she said yes?

992
00:48:11.598 --> 00:48:13.392
- Does that surprise you?

993
00:48:13.475 --> 00:48:15.352
- I think she's been on one
date since I've been here.

994
00:48:15.435 --> 00:48:17.853
And it did not go well.

995
00:48:17.938 --> 00:48:19.105
- What happened?

996
00:48:19.188 --> 00:48:21.190
- First dates can be tricky.

997
00:48:21.275 --> 00:48:23.318
- Clair, what happened?

998
00:48:23.402 --> 00:48:25.070
- Well, I'm just
the little sister,

999
00:48:25.153 --> 00:48:26.572
so what do I know?

1000
00:48:26.655 --> 00:48:27.488
- Clair knows all.

1001
00:48:27.572 --> 00:48:29.532
She's clairvoyant.

1002
00:48:30.867 --> 00:48:34.245
- Two words, endless buffet.

1003
00:48:34.328 --> 00:48:37.165
- Ooh, first date red flag.

1004
00:48:37.248 --> 00:48:39.000
The guy was a cheapskate.

1005
00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:42.170
- Yeah, even I know a first
date buffet is a real bad idea,

1006
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:44.965
unless I'm real hungry.

1007
00:48:45.048 --> 00:48:46.257
(all chuckle)

1008
00:48:46.342 --> 00:48:48.343
- So what would Amy like?

1009
00:48:48.427 --> 00:48:50.470
- Something romantic.

1010
00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:52.888
- Something with candles.

1011
00:48:52.973 --> 00:48:55.392
- Something Italian.

1012
00:48:55.475 --> 00:48:57.102
- Something new to wear.

1013
00:48:57.185 --> 00:48:59.688
(solemn music)

1014
00:49:12.325 --> 00:49:14.995
(upbeat music)

1015
00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.623
- We need to get
you un-cowboyed.

1016
00:49:19.708 --> 00:49:21.543
- Yeah, that ranch hand look
may work around the ranch,

1017
00:49:21.627 --> 00:49:23.962
but you need to look like a
lady if you're going on a date.

1018
00:49:24.045 --> 00:49:25.255
- Thanks.

1019
00:49:25.338 --> 00:49:26.590
- Do you remember
that last date?

1020
00:49:26.673 --> 00:49:28.217
- That had nothing to do
with what I was wearing.

1021
00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.135
- Yeah, buffet boy
didn't deserve you.

1022
00:49:30.218 --> 00:49:31.928
- Chris is definitely
no buffet boy.

1023
00:49:32.012 --> 00:49:33.430
- Exactly.

1024
00:49:33.513 --> 00:49:35.140
- So we're gonna
need a fancy dress.

1025
00:49:35.223 --> 00:49:36.850
(Amy groans)

1026
00:49:36.933 --> 00:49:38.435
- [May] And to do
something with your hair.

1027
00:49:38.518 --> 00:49:40.603
- What's wrong with my hair?

1028
00:49:40.687 --> 00:49:43.523
- Just leave all day open.

00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:43.977

her to a buffet.

1060

- When was the last
time you had a date?

tell you this,

but the reason our sister
doesn't go on a lot

1063
00:51:57.115 --> 00:52:00.868
of dates is because she's been
waiting for the right person.

I'm really just right
where I want to be.

1083
00:53:22.617 --> 00:53:23.410
- I envy you.

1084
00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.120
Since my parents died,

1085
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:28.415
I don't really know
what I'm supposed to do.

1086
00:53:28.498 --> 00:53:31.000
I guess working at the
ranch has really saved me.

1087
00:53:33.085 --> 00:53:35.547
This sounds wrong,

1088
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:40.802
but I feel guilty
for my parents death.

1089
00:53:40.885 --> 00:53:43.847
I keep thinking maybe if I've
done something differently,

1090
00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:46.390
if I'd gotten better grades,

1091
00:53:46.473 --> 00:53:48.977
if I prayed more, something,

1092
00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:50.937
maybe they'd still be here.

1093
00:53:52.897 --> 00:53:56.483
- They're gone because of
somebody else's bad mistake.

1094
00:53:56.567 --> 00:53:57.610
It's not your fault.

1095
00:53:57.693 --> 00:53:59.028
It will never be your fault.

1096
00:54:00.738 --> 00:54:03.115
Take time, but you
just really have

1097
00:54:03.198 --> 00:54:06.535
to convince yourself that
whenever you feel guilty.

1098
00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.413
- Well, sometimes I'm not
my favorite person (laughs).

1099
00:54:09.872 --> 00:54:11.457
- Like Jesus said,

1100
00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:15.503
love God and love others
as you love yourself.

1101
00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:18.465
It's important to love yourself.

1102
00:54:18.548 --> 00:54:19.673
You know, God loves us.

1103
00:54:19.757 --> 00:54:22.385
So we’re lovable.

1104
00:54:22.927 --> 00:54:24.637
- You make it sound so easy.

1105
00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.263
- Sometimes love is easy.

1106
00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.310
(phone chimes)

1107
00:54:30.393 --> 00:54:33.688
(chuckles) What is it?

1108
00:54:34.563 --> 00:54:37.692
- (sighs) We should
probably get back, now.

1109
00:54:37.775 --> 00:54:39.152
- [All] Lauren, get out!

1110
00:54:39.235 --> 00:54:41.112
- I need to wash my hair!
- Hurry up!

1111
00:54:41.195 --> 00:54:43.823
(sisters chattering)

1112
00:54:43.907 --> 00:54:45.325
- How long has
she been in there?

1113
00:54:45.408 --> 00:54:46.660
- Hurry up!

1114
00:54:46.743 --> 00:54:49.328
- Okay, girls, girls, girls.

1115
00:54:49.412 --> 00:54:52.290
Come on, what's going on?

1116
00:54:52.373 --> 00:54:53.875
- [April] Lauren's in there,
and she won't come out.

1117
00:54:53.958 --> 00:54:56.168
- (sighs) Lauren, come
out here this minute.

1118
00:54:56.252 --> 00:54:57.795
- No.
- Young lady.

1119
00:54:57.878 --> 00:54:59.172
- Hey, hey, hey,
hey, shh, shh, shh.

1120
00:54:59.255 --> 00:55:01.967
Hey, just give me
one minute, okay.

1121
00:55:02.883 --> 00:55:05.303
One minute, trust me,
this is what I do.

1122
00:55:05.387 --> 00:55:06.387
- Okay, go on.
- All right, cool.

1123
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:07.888
All right, come on.

1124
00:55:16.647 --> 00:55:20.777
Lauren, it's Christian, just me.

1125
00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:22.237
- [Lauren] Leave me alone.

1126
00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.070
- Please.

1127
00:55:24.822 --> 00:55:26.115
Come on, I really need
your help with something.

1128
00:55:26.198 --> 00:55:26.950
- [Lauren] What?

1129
00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:30.328
- It's about my date with Amy.

1130
00:55:31.287 --> 00:55:32.997
And you know her
better than I do.

1131
00:55:34.123 --> 00:55:35.375
I could really use your help.

1132
00:55:36.625 --> 00:55:38.002
Can I come in?

1133
00:55:38.085 --> 00:55:38.837
- Okay.

1134
00:55:49.638 --> 00:55:52.017
I wasn't trying for red.

1135
00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.727
- All right, well,
lucky for you,

1136
00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:55.978
this is not the first case

1137
00:55:56.103 --> 00:55:59.232
of unwanted red
hair I've ever had.

1138
00:55:59.315 --> 00:56:02.277
I'd say about three hair
emergencies a semester.

1139
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.487
All right, but I
know just what to do.

1140
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:06.530
(playful music)

1141
00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:08.492
- [Lauren] I hope you're right.

1142
00:56:08.575 --> 00:56:11.035
- [Christian] Well, we'll
know in about five minutes.

1143
00:56:19.085 --> 00:56:20.128
- I'm going to bed.

1144
00:56:20.212 --> 00:56:21.337
- Is everything okay?

1145
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:22.422
- Yes.

1146
00:56:23.255 --> 00:56:24.798
- Well, good night, then.

1147
00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:27.468
Did you do something
to your hair?

1148
00:56:32.432 --> 00:56:34.017
Not gonna tell me, huh?

1149
00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.268
- Ministerial counseling
confidentiality.

1150
00:56:39.105 --> 00:56:40.607
It's getting late, though.

1151
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:41.775
I should go.

1152
00:56:41.858 --> 00:56:44.277
(gentle music)

1153
00:56:51.325 --> 00:56:52.868
- You've managed to do
something no one's done

1154
00:56:52.952 --> 00:56:54.453
in a long time.

1155
00:56:54.537 --> 00:56:55.455
- What's that?

1156
00:56:55.538 --> 00:56:56.288
- Surprise me.

1157
00:56:57.123 --> 00:56:58.708
Thank you.

1158
00:56:58.792 --> 00:57:01.585
- Have we waited
long enough yet?

1159
00:57:01.668 --> 00:57:02.212
- You wish.

1160
00:57:12.263 --> 00:57:17.268
(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)

1161
00:57:17.727 --> 00:57:19.270
(phone clicking)

1162
00:57:19.353 --> 00:57:21.730
- Had a really good
time, smiley face.

1163
00:57:23.525 --> 00:57:26.152
(phone beeps)

1164
00:57:35.453 --> 00:57:38.122
(phone clicking)

1165
00:57:40.667 --> 00:57:44.003
(phone beeps)

1166
00:57:44.087 --> 00:57:45.087
"Me too.

1167
00:57:46.505 --> 00:57:48.173
"Thank you for treating
me like a lady.

1168
00:57:48.257 --> 00:57:51.302
"It was nice to be
a girl for a night."

1169
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:56.515
Hope I get to see her
again, smiley face.

1170
00:57:57.892 --> 00:58:00.143
Thank you for sharing that
part of yourself with me.

1171
00:58:01.897 --> 00:58:03.565
Good night.

1172
00:58:03.648 --> 00:58:05.983
(phone beeps)

1173
00:58:08.737 --> 00:58:11.322
(dramatic music)

1174
00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:18.913
(gentle music)

1175
00:59:50.588 --> 00:59:53.215
(dramatic music)

1176
01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:01.200
Amy, what do you want?

1177
01:01:02.327 --> 01:01:04.162
- Us to ride together
on horseback.

1178
01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:07.707
- Amy, what do you want, really?

1179
01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.793
- I want my parents back.

1180
01:01:12.962 --> 01:01:14.213
- All right.

1181
01:01:15.382 --> 01:01:18.718
You see, I can't give you that.

1182
01:01:18.802 --> 01:01:21.553
Ever since we met, you
have this, this wall,

1183
01:01:21.637 --> 01:01:22.930
and I can't fix it.

1184
01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:24.348
- What's going on?

1185
01:01:24.432 --> 01:01:25.558
Did something happen?

1186
01:01:25.642 --> 01:01:27.143
Did--
- I just think I'm starting

1187
01:01:27.227 --> 01:01:31.147
to realize that maybe
God doesn't want me here.

1188
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:32.857
- Chris, I've never
seen you like this.

1189
01:01:36.152 --> 01:01:38.112
- Do you think you could
ever forgive the man

1190
01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:39.738
who killed your parents?

1191
01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:41.948
- No, of course not!

1192
01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.575
Who could?

1193
01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.995
- And I don't think
I can, either, okay,

1194
01:01:46.078 --> 01:01:49.082
because he's the one
who gave you this wall.

1195
01:01:49.165 --> 01:01:50.708
And I know we have
this connection, but--

1196
01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:53.377
- I don't see what
this has to do with us.

1197
01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.463
- Amy, Tim killed your parents.

1198
01:01:57.423 --> 01:02:00.885
Tim, my friend Tim,
is the drunk driver

1199
01:02:00.968 --> 01:02:02.887
who crashed that car.

1200
01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:04.680
- What?

1201
01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.022
- I spoke to his parents.

1202
01:02:14.107 --> 01:02:15.650
They told me about the crash.

1203
01:02:17.943 --> 01:02:19.695
They told me about
the couple he killed.

1204
01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:22.157
- Tim?

1205
01:02:24.242 --> 01:02:27.203
He took them away.

1206
01:02:27.287 --> 01:02:28.997
He was here that whole time?

1207
01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.247
- I spoke to your uncle.

1208
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.500
Tim told him everything.

1209
01:02:35.462 --> 01:02:37.963
He said he was here to
be a guardian angel.

1210
01:02:38.047 --> 01:02:41.008
He tried to make amends.

1211
01:02:41.092 --> 01:02:42.302
- My uncle knew?

1212
01:02:42.385 --> 01:02:43.760
And he let that man...

1213
01:02:45.638 --> 01:02:46.888
When you showed up,

1214
01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:48.098
I thought it was God
bringing something good

1215
01:02:48.182 --> 01:02:50.225
from something bad.

1216
01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:51.560
That's what they say, right?

1217
01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:54.522
God can take a bad
situation and make it good.

1218
01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:56.773
I thought all this was
to bring us together.

1219
01:02:56.857 --> 01:02:57.775
And your friend,

1220
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:00.653
your friend...

1221
01:03:02.655 --> 01:03:04.407
He didn't just bring you here.

1222
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:05.992
He brought me here
to kill me, too.

1223
01:03:06.075 --> 01:03:07.660
- Amy!

1224
01:03:07.743 --> 01:03:08.660

01:04:27.323 --> 01:04:28.240
- Why are you here?

1249
01:04:29.158 --> 01:04:30.660
It can't be because of me.

1250
01:04:30.743 --> 01:04:31.952
And I thought you weren't
interested in being a cowboy.

1251
01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:33.203
- I'm not.

1252
01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:34.538
- Maybe Ray was right.

1253
01:04:34.622 --> 01:04:35.582
- What, so only cowboy's count?

1254
01:04:35.665 --> 01:04:36.623
- That's not my point.

1255
01:04:36.707 --> 01:04:38.125
- What is your point?

1256
01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.502
- Why are you in front of me?

1257
01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:41.753
- Listen, I just couldn't leave

1258
01:04:41.837 --> 01:04:43.172
with the way things are
between us right now.

1259
01:04:43.255 --> 01:04:44.382
I just wanted to talk.

1260
01:04:44.465 --> 01:04:46.342
- Talk all you want,
just not to me.

1261
01:04:46.425 --> 01:04:49.720
- I'm gonna do this
service, Amy, okay?

1262
01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:51.513
And it's not gonna
be a celebration.

1263
01:04:51.597 --> 01:04:53.223
It's not gonna be an
honorary for Tim, okay.

1264
01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:54.683
It's gonna be a warning,

1265
01:04:54.767 --> 01:04:57.018
about trusting people
too much, okay.

1266
01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:57.853
Then, I'm gone.

1267
01:04:59.605 --> 01:05:01.523
- Then Ray was right
about that building.

1268
01:05:01.607 --> 01:05:03.150
By next week, that church'll
just be another mess

1269
01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:04.402
for me and the
girls to clean up.

1270
01:05:04.485 --> 01:05:06.362
Just go back to
playing at college.

1271
01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:07.530
The people there can
come and go in your life,

1272
01:05:07.613 --> 01:05:09.615
and you don't even have to ask.

1273
01:05:09.698 --> 01:05:11.367
You said God doesn't
want you here,

1274
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:12.158
neither do I.

- So have you
texted her yet, man?

1295
01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:20.537
- She doesn't text me back.

1296
01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.330
- You know, you're not
supposed to text a girl

1297
01:07:22.415 --> 01:07:24.875
after three times, if she
doesn't text you back, right?

1298
01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:26.168
- How many times did
you text her, anyway?

1299
01:07:26.252 --> 01:07:27.168
- More than three.

1300
01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:28.170
(Justin scoffs)

1301
01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:29.297
- Hey, hey!

1302
01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.340
What are you doing here?

1303
01:07:31.423 --> 01:07:32.717
You don't belong here, man.

1304
01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.050
Why don't you go
up to the house,

1305
01:07:34.135 --> 01:07:35.552
help one of the other
girls with their hair?

1306
01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:37.638
I don't know what you
did to Amy last night,

1307
01:07:37.722 --> 01:07:38.847
but that cold, bossy,
little--

1308
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:40.933
- Don't you dare talk
about her like that!

1309
01:07:41.017 --> 01:07:42.560
- Oh yeah, what are
you gonna do about it?

1310
01:07:42.643 --> 01:07:44.353
- You don't have a clue
what she's going through.

1311
01:07:44.437 --> 01:07:45.855
- Oh yeah, well--

1312
01:07:45.938 --> 01:07:47.355
- As if some old drunk knows
anything about being there

1313
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.648
for someone who
needs him, right.

1314
01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:50.608
- Oh man, it's on!
- Ray, Ray, Ray!

1315
01:07:50.692 --> 01:07:51.443
(Ray grunts)

1316
01:07:51.527 --> 01:07:53.237
Ray, Ray, come on, man.

1317
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.572
Remember what the judge said.

1318
01:07:54.655 --> 01:07:56.198
One more fight,
you'll go to jail.

1319
01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:59.702
(solemn music)

1320
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:02.328
- [Donovan] You okay, man?

1321
01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:03.122
- Yeah.

1322
01:08:09.503 --> 01:08:11.005
- What's up?

1323
01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:12.338
- Yeah, I just wanted
to talk to everybody,

1324
01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:15.802
well, not talk, but apologize.

1325
01:08:15.885 --> 01:08:17.177
I'm afraid I just
brought you all out here

1326
01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.053
for something that's
just not gonna happen.

1327
01:08:19.137 --> 01:08:20.388
- What are you
talking about, man?

1328
01:08:20.472 --> 01:08:21.140
We can get this done.

1329
01:08:21.223 --> 01:08:22.600
- No.

1330
01:08:22.683 --> 01:08:25.060
I found out some
stuff about Tim.

1331
01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:26.353
I don't even know

1332
01:08:26.437 --> 01:08:29.105
if doing this service
is gonna do any good.

1333
01:08:29.190 --> 01:08:32.150
I just, uh (sniffs),
I don't know.

1334
01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:32.985
I'm beat down.

1335
01:08:33.985 --> 01:08:36.197
- Are you talking
about Tim's crash?

1336
01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.198
- The drunk driver accident?

1337
01:08:38.282 --> 01:08:40.617
- He told you guys?

1338
01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.368
He trusted all of
you guys, and not me?

1339
01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:44.372
- It wasn't about trust.

1340
01:08:44.455 --> 01:08:46.040
It was about shame.

1341
01:08:46.123 --> 01:08:48.292
He was ashamed of
what he had done.

1342
01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:49.668
- He knew he'd let you down.

1343
01:08:49.752 --> 01:08:51.087
He couldn't face it.

1344
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:54.340
So he turned his back on you.

1345
01:08:54.423 --> 01:08:55.298
- It's a lot more than that.

1346
01:08:55.382 --> 01:08:58.177
All right, you don't know, okay,

1347
01:08:59.428 --> 01:09:01.180
to have a dead friend just
pull the rug right out

1348
01:09:01.263 --> 01:09:02.472
from under you like that.

1349
01:09:02.557 --> 01:09:03.723
- When you get hurt like that,

1350
01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:06.977
it just shows how much you care.

1351
01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.230
- Come on, remember what
we always used to say?

1352
01:09:09.313 --> 01:09:11.273
Where there's faith,
there's Faith Club.

1353
01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:15.652
- I'm afraid I just don't
have much to say these days.

1354
01:09:16.737 --> 01:09:18.447
I think this is the
end of the Faith Club.

1355
01:09:28.873 --> 01:09:31.585
- Amy, you wanted to see me?

1356
01:09:31.668 --> 01:09:33.045
- Yeah, May was out on the ATV

1357
01:09:33.128 --> 01:09:34.963
and got it stuck
in that south wash.

1358
01:09:35.047 --> 01:09:36.965
Can you and Zeke go pick
it up before it gets dark?

1359
01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:38.258
- No, I can't do it today.

1360
01:09:38.342 --> 01:09:39.677
It sounds like a two-man job,

1361
01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:42.345
and Zeke's in town
picking up some gear.

1362
01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:43.513
(Amy sighs)

1363
01:09:43.597 --> 01:09:44.307
- I'll get my gloves.

1364
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:45.557
I'll go with you.

1365
01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.642
- I'll go.

1366
01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.437
- Sounds like a two-man job.

1367
01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:51.563
- Thanks, Chris.

1368
01:09:52.857 --> 01:09:53.898
Ray?

1369
01:09:54.942 --> 01:09:57.862
- All right, he can
carry the toolbox.

1370
01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:01.157
(solemn music)

1371
01:10:06.662 --> 01:10:09.790
(Christian grunting)

1372
01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:49.245
Hand me a screwdriver.

1373
01:10:51.332 --> 01:10:52.082
Phillips.

1374
01:10:58.213 --> 01:10:58.922
- Ray,

1375
01:11:01.217 --> 01:11:03.843
I really should apologize
to you for what I said.

1376
01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:06.055
- Nothing you said needs
any apologizing for.

1377
01:11:06.138 --> 01:11:07.890
You probably should
be thanking Zeke.

1378
01:11:07.973 --> 01:11:10.725
He's the one who stopped me
from knocking your block off.

1379
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.270
I'm probably going
to jail anyways.

1380
01:11:14.897 --> 01:11:16.648
- Jail, why is that?

1381
01:11:16.732 --> 01:11:17.858
- None of your business.

1382
01:11:17.942 --> 01:11:19.192
- Well, maybe it's something
I can help you with.

1383
01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.360
- Stop!

1384
01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:21.820
Stop trying to preacher me.

1385
01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:26.117
I kinda busted up a
place a few weeks ago.

1386
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.577
I get out of control
when I drink.

1387
01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:32.497
- A lot of people do.

1388
01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.292
- Judge ordered me to
go to a few AA meetings.

1389
01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:37.377
- And if you don't,
you go to jail.

1390
01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.420
- Most likely.

1391
01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:41.340
- So you're saying
you'd rather go to jail

1392
01:11:41.423 --> 01:11:42.340
than go to a few AA meetings?

1393
01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:44.175
- It's 10.

1394
01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:44.968
- Well?

1395
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:50.098
- Jail doesn't scare me
like those AA meetings do.

1396
01:11:50.182 --> 01:11:53.102
I don't really like
talking in front of people.

1397
01:11:53.185 --> 01:11:53.893
- You?

1398
01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.438
Well, tell you what,
when's your next one?

1399
01:11:57.522 --> 01:11:58.440
- Tomorrow.

1400
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.692
- I'll go with you.

1401
01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:02.152
- Why would you do that?

1402
01:12:03.028 --> 01:12:04.363
- Friends support friends.

1403
01:12:05.155 --> 01:12:07.240
- Oh, we're friends now, huh?

1404
01:12:09.743 --> 01:12:11.620
Zeke shoulda let me
knock your block off.

1405
01:12:13.788 --> 01:12:16.208
(solemn music)

1406
01:12:54.997 --> 01:12:58.833
- Mom, Dad, I found
the man who killed you

1407
01:12:58.917 --> 01:13:00.502
and who took you away from me.

1408
01:13:02.337 --> 01:13:03.880
I didn't want to see
him as someone real.

1409
01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:05.507
I didn't want to know
anything about him.

1410
01:13:06.467 --> 01:13:08.052
I thought that'd
keep the hate away,

1411
01:13:08.135 --> 01:13:10.178
but it just buried
it deeper inside.

1412
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:15.392
I've been working beside
him for three years.

1413
01:13:15.475 --> 01:13:17.518
He was a good man.

1414
01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:19.938
But how could I forgive him
for something like that?

1415
01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:22.482
And the bad keeps spreading.

1416
01:13:23.442 --> 01:13:24.818
I can't stand to
look at his friend,

1417
01:13:24.902 --> 01:13:27.863
because they're connected.

1418
01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:31.450
And Tim's not
there, so I can't...

1419
01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:36.122
How could Uncle like
to me like that?

1420
01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.373
How could he let
that man near me?

1421
01:13:40.042 --> 01:13:41.083
- Amy.

1422
01:13:50.177 --> 01:13:53.847
(Christian coughs)

1423
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.015
I walked up here for Tim.

1424
01:13:57.017 --> 01:13:59.978
I just had to forgive him

1425
01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:02.982
for hurting somebody
that I really care about.

1426
01:14:03.065 --> 01:14:05.733
(gentle music)

1427
01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:09.655
And well, forgiveness is
an act of faith, isn't it?

1428
01:14:11.323 --> 01:14:13.283
Faith is about love.

1429
01:14:13.367 --> 01:14:14.535
They're just connected.

1430
01:14:16.162 --> 01:14:17.287
Jesus loves us,

1431
01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:20.415
has faith in us.

1432
01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:24.335
So he forgave us for
all our shortcomings.

1433
01:14:26.755 --> 01:14:27.965
As hard as that may be,

1434
01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:33.970
it's up to you, it's up to us,

1435
01:14:35.097 --> 01:14:37.182
to accept that forgiveness.

1436
01:14:40.102 --> 01:14:42.897
That faith, that love,
that forgiveness,

1437
01:14:45.315 --> 01:14:46.148
it sets you free, Amy.

1438
01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:50.653
It'll set us free.

1439
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.918
You want me to leave?

1440
01:15:07.337 --> 01:15:10.257
- No, I think I
want you to stay.

- Hello, everybody.

1454
01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:24.163
My name is Christian,
and I want to introduce

1455
01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.458
to you a, uh, friend of mine.

1456
01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.172
- Hello, my name is Ray.

1457
01:16:33.298 --> 01:16:34.257
- [All] Hello, Ray.

1458
01:16:37.177 --> 01:16:40.472
(gentle music)

1459
01:16:40.555 --> 01:16:42.307
- [Donna] Hey,
girls, we're home.

1460
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:45.893
- You know what, can you guys
help your mom with the bags?

1461
01:16:45.977 --> 01:16:48.022
- Come on, girls, I've
got gifts for you all.

1462
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:55.528
(Tom sighs)

1463
01:16:56.572 --> 01:16:58.615
- Everything go okay?

1464
01:16:58.698 --> 01:17:01.283
- Yup, we got everything
taken care of.

1465
01:17:01.368 --> 01:17:03.120
You know, your aunt and I
aren't gettin' any younger,

1466
01:17:03.203 --> 01:17:05.497
and we'd like to pull
back some from the ranch.

1467
01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:08.542
- I can take more of the
responsibilities myself.

1468
01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:10.293
- No, we already
made our decision,

1469
01:17:10.377 --> 01:17:12.087
and the papers have been signed.

1470
01:17:13.505 --> 01:17:15.090
- You sold the ranch?

1471
01:17:15.173 --> 01:17:16.215
- Not exactly.

1472
01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.760
We're givin' it to you.

1473
01:17:19.678 --> 01:17:21.178
You know, you're so much
a part of this place

1474
01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:24.140
that it's more
yours than ours now.

1475
01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:28.187
- I don't know what to say.

1476
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:29.813
- It's not gonna
happen tomorrow.

1477
01:17:29.897 --> 01:17:31.482
We've still got a
lot of work to do.

1478
01:17:31.565 --> 01:17:34.525
But for now, why don't you
go talk with your sisters.

1479
01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:36.277
I'm sure they've
found out by now.

1480
01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:41.867
(Tom laughs)

1481
01:17:42.533 --> 01:17:44.118
(Christian laughs)

1482
01:17:44.202 --> 01:17:46.663
- Wow, how long have
you been planning this?

1483
01:17:46.747 --> 01:17:49.457
- I probably knew from the
first year she was here.

1484
01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.543
You know, Chris, when we
talked the other night,

1485
01:17:51.627 --> 01:17:52.877
I didn't tell you
that I'm the one

1486
01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.755
that found Tim that day.

1487
01:17:55.547 --> 01:17:57.382
I saw his horse from my truck.

1488
01:17:57.465 --> 01:18:01.177
And by the time I got there,
I could see he was breathing,

1489
01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:03.388
but the way he was laying there,

1490
01:18:03.472 --> 01:18:05.390
I knew I couldn't move him.

1491
01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:07.933
And then he said something
that really blew my mind.

1492
01:18:09.268 --> 01:18:11.647
He said, "This is the day
that the Lord has made.

1493
01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:14.190
"I will rejoice
and be glad in it."

1494
01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:20.280
Then he said, "This is the day
that we're all waiting for.

1495
01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:22.782
"I'm gonna see Jesus today."

1496
01:18:23.742 --> 01:18:26.368
(Tom coughs)

1497
01:18:26.453 --> 01:18:28.580
So I sat there for
about 10 minutes

1498
01:18:28.663 --> 01:18:31.165
with him, smiling,
and me crying.

1499
01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:33.418
And then he passed.

1500
01:18:35.545 --> 01:18:36.588
- Wow.

1501
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:42.552
I really appreciate you
sharing that with me.

1502
01:18:42.635 --> 01:18:44.220
- It's been a long day for me.

1503
01:18:51.603 --> 01:18:54.105
(solemn music)

1504
01:18:59.193 --> 01:19:00.237
- [Christian] Hey, what is this?

1505
01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:10.122
- Oh (chuckles),
that's Tim's bike.

1506
01:19:10.205 --> 01:19:11.413
- Tim had a motorcycle?

1507
01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:13.750
I had a dirt bike
when I was a kid.

1508
01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:15.502
He would never get on the thing.

1509
01:19:15.585 --> 01:19:17.337

he was ever afraid of.

1528
01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:40.337

where to get 100 chairs.

1529
01:20:42.255 --> 01:20:44.673
- How about sittin'

1530

"that Christ Jesus
came into the world

1543
01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:49.488
"to save sinners of
whom I am chief."

1544
01:21:50.532 --> 01:21:51.992
That's from the first chapter,

1545
01:21:52.075 --> 01:21:54.827
14th and 15th verse
of First Timothy.

1546
01:21:56.162 --> 01:21:57.705
The Books of Timothy
in the Bible are

1547
01:21:57.788 --> 01:22:01.000
about building Christ's
church here on Earth,

1548
01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:04.337
building it on
truth, truth of God,

1549
01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:07.423
the truth of the good
news, the truth of love.

1550
01:22:08.675 --> 01:22:11.552
And to get to that truth,
we've got to have faith.

1551
01:22:11.637 --> 01:22:13.178
It's only done through faith.

1552
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:18.058
This Timothy here is one
for the ages, for everybody.

1553
01:22:20.187 --> 01:22:22.063
I was blessed enough in my life

1554
01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:26.192
to know my own Timothy, my
best friend since childhood.

1555
01:22:27.693 --> 01:22:30.405
Because of him, the place
we're in here tonight,

1556
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:33.325
he's the reason for that.

1557
01:22:37.203 --> 01:22:39.663
He first had a
vision to see this

1558
01:22:40.748 --> 01:22:43.627
but then also the faith to
work towards it as well.

1559
01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:48.548
And his faith
influenced our faith

1560
01:22:48.632 --> 01:22:51.467
to keep working on it
until here we are tonight,

1561
01:22:51.592 --> 01:22:52.802
all of us here together.

1562
01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:57.348
And even then, Tim knew
that church didn't have

1563
01:22:57.432 --> 01:23:00.893
to be some white
clapboard building

1564
01:23:00.977 --> 01:23:05.482
with a tall steeple
or even a cathedral,

1565
01:23:05.565 --> 01:23:09.360
made of stone, awe-inspiring
in its grandeur, no.

1566
01:23:10.987 --> 01:23:13.072
He knew that church is us.

1567
01:23:14.657 --> 01:23:16.743
It's us here with
our changed hearts,

1568
01:23:16.827 --> 01:23:20.830
our saved souls, whether
you're in a cold jail cell

1569
01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:23.750
or you're here, free,

1570
01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:30.090
wall-less, in the
very masterpiece that
is God's creation.

1571
01:23:31.382 --> 01:23:34.343
No, church is here, in us.

1572
01:23:36.888 --> 01:23:41.433
The Timothy I know
just passed recently.

1573
01:23:41.517 --> 01:23:44.187
And his grave, just up
there in those hills,

1574
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:45.730
but I still see him here,

1575
01:23:47.315 --> 01:23:49.567
in each and every
face that I look into.

1576
01:23:51.027 --> 01:23:53.237
His faith in God kept him going

1577
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:56.615
through a lot of
terrible, terrible times.

1578
01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:57.700
That's what faith and love do.

1579
01:23:57.783 --> 01:23:59.118
They keep us going.

1580
01:24:00.745 --> 01:24:04.957
And his days, in this old
world at least, are over,

1581
01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:10.338
no more roaming on the
range, just cowboy talk,

1582
01:24:10.422 --> 01:24:11.547
in case you didn't know that.

1583
01:24:12.507 --> 01:24:13.467
I didn't know that.

1584
01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:15.677
But he's home.

1585
01:24:19.097 --> 01:24:21.473
He's home, and while he's there,

1586
01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:23.560
we're all here still
on our own trail.

1587
01:24:24.935 --> 01:24:28.857
Let's hold on to that faith,

- I’ve been doing some thinking.

1609
01:25:58.655 --> 01:26:00.615
There's just a moment you have

1610
01:26:00.698 --> 01:26:03.408
that you realize that
everything is comming,

1611
01:26:04.827 --> 01:26:07.830
always to be, just
so clearly connected.

1612

stopped being me,

01:26:18.592 --> 01:26:19.633
and we became us.
